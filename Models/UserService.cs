// Implementing the O in SOLID
// O stands for SRP; Open-closed Principle
// The Open/closed Principle says, "A software module/class is open for extension and closed for modification."

// Open Closed Principle

// Here:
// "Open for extension" means we must design our module/class so that the new functionality can be added only when new requirements are generated. 
// "Closed for modification" means we have already developed a class, and it has gone through unit testing. We should then not alter it until we find bugs. 
// As it says, a class should be open for extensions; we can use inheritance. OK, let's dive into an example.

// Suppose we have a Rectangle class with the properties Height and Width.
